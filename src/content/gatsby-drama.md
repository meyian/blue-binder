To accompany the launch of the new Gatsby website, Nat Alison, a former Gatsby contractor, started a Twitter thread about her unhappy experience working with the Gatsby company.

She says a lot in this thread. At some point in reading, I, feeling cozy, wanted a hot mug of black tea to enjoy along with it. It was a stimulating, chin-stroking read. I think the major point of contention was that after trying in different ways to address shortcomings with the company and the project she was working on, she was eventually told her time was up and was given a golden handshake.

While working as a contributor to the Gatsby codebase, I had one short interaction with Nat, and it was so positive that I went to look her up. She's also an artist, has a popular Open Source contribution, and an army of Twitter followers. So I was surprised that her involvement with Gatsby, a project I'm very invested in, gave her such a bitter aftertaste that she wrote an over 60-tweet thread about how unfun it all was for her. Immediately, I took her side. But after a couple days to think about it, though, I'm a bit more torn.

Okay, so Gatsby management is opinionated and reneges on agreements they made about support for her project. And their commitment to inclusion, diversity and social justice issues is purely token. Dare I even say self-serving? Possibly. But then again, unless you imagined a company with your average white CEO is concerned about anything other than business, this is all pretty much par for the course and to be expected. I have worked with companies that didn't even care to give themselves the gloss of concern for what's going on in the world outside. And as for walking back on the agreements they made to do things her way concerning her project, well, once again, this is the sort of thing that happens. CEOs and other bigshots in a company can often change their mind and feel like justification is a waste of their time.

In the end, I suppose there's a point to trying to hold companies accountable, particularly if you have a platform to use, but I don't know if Gatsby has done anything particularly egregious considering todays corporate landscape. All they're doing is doing nothing, but that's what most do anyway. In reaction to Nat's essay, the CEO wrote an annodyne blog post that didn't outline any clear or actionable steps of improvement, but then again, were we expecting an about-turn? Six months or a year later, you think Kyle will write a follow-up blog post on how far they've come since? He's just trying to get through his day.

Them's the breaks.
