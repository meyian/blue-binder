An excerpt of something I recently posted on Twitter:

I wanted to get into it more, so I decided to write this blog post.

It's in praise of the written word, as seen by a computer programmer and literature-lover combination. That's right. Books were actually my first love. But I'm not here to talk about the ability of words to stimulate emotion, I'm talking about the raw power to illustrate concepts. I'm including law, and computer code, and annotations next to poorly drawn storyboards. If language were a mapping from the range of possibilities into a human language, how gigantic is the domain. Maybe it's all reducable to words. Maybe anything you can imagine can be put down on the page.

Perhaps all you have to do is to try and put anything you like into words and start knocking it into shape. And who knows, at the end, you finally just might have what you wanted. Maybe if you don't try to put it into words, it's all just another vague feeling that escapes your ability to say anything about it and then vanishes.

I have a personal algorithm like that. When I'm working on something, I will write it down as a heading. Then start a bullet point list underneath it about I need to do about it. If an entry is too vague, start a bullet-point under that. I like making lists. It's a fast way to visualize what needs to be done.

I like to think that every project, from directing a movie to launching a flight into space, can be broken down into a simplified tree of bullet points. So as I set about trying to accomplish whatever my imagination has set its sights on, whenever I'm faced with the vague, I try to wrestle it down into words and make a bullet-point list of what I know about it.

If we are the original computer, and algorithms are the recipes for everything nice, from spanakopita to Lupita N'yongo's performance in Black Panther, then to get what you want you often have to invent new algorithms. No matter how complicated it gets, an algorithm is only an ordered list. So maybe defeat the vague by starting there. Want to write a book with such and such a detail about it? Maybe half a year is spent swelling and shrinking the size of a bullet-point list you keep in a file.

Want to code the next app to go viral? The point of my tweet was that it's fine to spend the time you set aside for your project just tinkering with todo lists. That totally counts as work. You don't necessarily have to be typing out code to be at work. Sometimes you have to treat yourself like the computer, and make a computer a program in the form of a list for yourself to follow. And that kind of _computer programming_ 100% counts as computer programming. It's all in the name of getting the most out of yourself, the first and (still) the best kind of computer.
