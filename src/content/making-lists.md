An excerpt of something I recently posted on Twitter:

I wanted to get into it more, so I decided to write this blog post.

I hereby write in praise of the written word, as seen by a computer programmer and a literature-lover. That's right. Books were actually my first love. But I'm not here to talk about the ability of words to hypnotize and stimulate emotion, I'm talking about the raw power of words to illustrate concepts. I'm including law, and computer code, and annotations next to poorly drawn storyboards. If language were a mapping from the range of possibilities into a human language, how gigantic is the domain. Maybe it's all reducable to words. Maybe anything you can imagine can be put down on the page.
I hereby write in praise of the written word, as seen by a computer programmer and a literature-lover. That's right. Books were actually my first love. But I'm not here to talk about the ability of words to stimulate emotions in a story, I'm talking about the raw power of words to illustrate sheer concepts. I'm including law, and computer code, and annotations next to poorly drawn storyboards. If language were a mapping from the range of all possibilities into a human language, how gigantic is the domain. Maybe everything is reducable to words. Maybe anything you can imagine can be put down on the page.

Say I'm right. Then perhaps all you have to do to succeed is try putting anything you like into words and start knocking it into shape. And who knows, at the end, you finally just might have what you wanted. How beautiful is your mind? Right now, only you know. Maybe if you don't try to put it into words, life is a series of vague feelings that vanish after escaping your ability to say anything about it.

I have a personal algorithm I use as a tool to turn the ellusive ideas into something real. Whenever anything I'm working on seems big or vague, I will down a heading for it. Then, underneath, I will fill out a bullet-point list, listing what I know about it. If an entry is either too vague or too interesting, start another bullet-point list under that. I like making lists. It's a great way to get a scale-reading on what needs to be done.

I believe that every project, from directing a movie to launching a flight into space, can be broken down into a simplified list of bullet points. So as I set about my day, trying to accomplish whatever my imagination has set its sights on, whenever I'm faced with the vague, I try to wrestle it down into words and tie it up with a bullet-point list of what I know about it.

If we are the original computer, and algorithms are the recipes for everything nice, from spanakopita to Lupita N'yongo's performance in Black Panther, then to get what you want you often have to invent new algorithms. No matter how complicated it gets, an algorithm is only an ordered list. So maybe defeat the insurmountable by starting there. Want to write a book with such and such a detail about it? Maybe it's necessary to spend half a year just growing and shrinking the size of a bullet-point list you keep in a file somewhere.

Want to code the next app to go viral? The same probably holds. At that was the point of my tweet. That it's entirely fine to spend the session you set aside for your project just tinkering with todo lists. That totally counts as work. You don't necessarily have to be typing out code to be at work. Sometimes you have to treat yourself like the computer, and make a computer a program in the form of a list for yourself to follow. And that kind of _computer programming_ 100% counts as computer programming. It's all in the name of getting the most you can out of yourself, the first and (still) the best kind of computer.
