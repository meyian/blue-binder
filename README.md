# Blue Binder

A notebook/blog, chronicling my (Hassan Abudu's) 100 days of Gatsby.

Should I pair this with the reading of the book? I dunno, what do you think? What you should do is shot me an email at <meyian@gmail.com> and let me know if I should, or shouldn't. (Do it, it'll be fun for both of us!)

Other than that, here's the blog in the wild: <http://blue-binder.surge.sh/>
